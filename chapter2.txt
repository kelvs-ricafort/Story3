During April 28, 2013 I searched the internet for an online job because I am tired of playing games and doing nothing.
My college classmate Patrick Tan introduced me to Genashtim Innovative Learning Pte Ltd. and ask me to try out in the company. 
And I did what he said, I whipped up my resum√© and sent to their HR and after a few days I was ask for an interview. 
Luckily i was chosen to be
an assistant to the HR Manager, and later on transferred to the IT department Abled Online because of my IT Skills. I was
promoted to full time 3 months later, they asked me if I want to be a mobile apps developer for them and I said yes and
later on handled EMT (EPiC Monitoring Team) as a staff there. There I learned how to interact with students and coaches
with their session. I resigned from Genashtim in 2021 and I went in hiatus again for 6 months. After 6 months I was searching 
for a job opening on the internet and I found Tera Systems Inc. which offered me a job as a mobile apps developer for 2 months.

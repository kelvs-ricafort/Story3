During my elementary days, I was excelling at english, and science, though I hated Mathematics. I survived elementay school with the help of
my teachers who tutored me and my parents who are supporting me in my endeavour. During my high school days I realized I was fascinated 
by computers (my younger sister has computer class on her school). Music was my outlet
when I am stressed and I would pick up my guitar and sing a song until my stress levels are gone.
This led me to a bachelor's degree in computer programming course in college at AMA Computer Learning Center. Where I graduated at 2007. I
went out for a 6 year hiatus before joining my first company.
